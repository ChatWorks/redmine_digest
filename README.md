Send daily/weekly/monthly digest

## Description

With this plugin redmine users can create some digest rules and receive digests every day/week/month.

## Installation

1. Copy plugin directory into REDMINE_ROOT/plugins.
If you are downloading the plugin directly from GitHub,
you can do so by changing into your REDMINE_ROOT directory and issuing a command like

        git clone https://github.com/Undev/redmine_digest.git plugins/redmine_digest

2. Run the following command to run migrations (make a db backup before).

        bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

3. You now need to restart Redmine so that it shows the newly installed plugin in the list of installed plugins ("Administration -> Plugins").
4. Configure crontab to send digests. Here is example that send daily digests every day at 01:00, weekly digest every monday at 02:00 and monthly digest every 1 day of the month at 03:00

        0 1 * * * rvm use ruby-1.9.3 && cd /var/www/redmine && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake redmine_digest:send_daily
        0 2 * * 1 rvm use ruby-1.9.3 && cd /var/www/redmine && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake redmine_digest:send_weekly
